Since I watched the movies like 1000 times, why not build app as well?<br>
I wanted to make a LOTR themed project with TailwindCSS and Redux state managment.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- React

There is a list of books,you can view each movie trailer as well. <br>
You can search for any character you want and discription will be displayed. This part is made with redux.
<br>
And lastlly you can get a random qoute from any movie.
